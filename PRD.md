## 2. Problem & Opportunity (The "Why")

**2.1. Core Problem Statement (Data-Backed):**  
  * The global accessories and jewelry market is projected to reach over $500 billion by 2027, with a significant shift towards online retail. However, many online platforms lack a cohesive aesthetic vision, offer undifferentiated product curation, or fail to provide a seamless user experience across diverse price points. Customers seeking unique, tastefully designed pieces often navigate fragmented marketplaces, leading to decision fatigue and a disconnect from brand values. LunaSolscape.com addresses this by offering a curated selection with a strong brand identity and innovative browsing features, setting a new standard for online jewelry retail through its unique celestial-inspired aesthetic and dynamic user experience.
  * LunaSolScape aspires to be a complete brand box for coordinated accessories.
    * e.g. young men's belt buckles, rings, earrings, necklaces that are suitable for offices, school, and smart casual occasions.
    * e.g. or a young couple's first coordinated gold (sol) & silver (luna) couple pairing brand box.
  * *Guidance: Further research into specific market segments (e.g., affordable luxury, sustainable jewelry) and their online presence will refine this problem statement.*  

**2.2. Target Audience / Personas:**  
  * **Primary Persona: The "Aesthetic Seeker" (Mid-to-High Price Segment)** \- Values unique design, quality craftsmanship, and a compelling brand story. Likely tech-savvy, appreciates curated experiences, and seeks pieces that reflect personal style.  
  * **Secondary Persona: The "Conscious Consumer" (Mid-to-Affordable Price Segment)** \- Seeks stylish, well-designed accessories that are accessible without compromising on ethical sourcing or basic quality. Values transparency and ease of purchase.  
  * *Guidance: Detailed persona development will be conducted in the Discovery phase, including demographics, psychographics, and online shopping habits.*  

**2.3. Business Value & Strategic Alignment:**  
  * This website project spearheads LunaSolscape.com's strategic goal of establishing a strong brand presence in the online accessories and jewelry market. By offering a unique aesthetic experience and seamless functionality, we aim to capture a significant market share, drive high customer lifetime value, and achieve profitability within 24 months. It will enable direct-to-consumer sales, build brand loyalty, and provide a scalable platform for future growth.

    \]

**4.4. Non-Goals / Out of Scope (for MVP):**  
  * Advanced personalization features (e.g., multi-variate seasonal recommendations (probably machine learning) beyond basic browsing history).
  * Augmented Reality (AR) try-on features for jewelry.
  * Referral systems and loyalty programs to "level up" gamification system.
  * User-generated content (e.g., product reviews with photos/videos) beyond basic text reviews.
  * Multi-language support (initial launch will be English. Chinese is next language pending translator Mosquito Killer).

## **5\. User Experience & Design (The "How" \- Visual & Interaction)**

**5.1. Basic User Flows:**  
  * Homepage → Product Discovery → Product Detail → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order Confirmation
  * Homepage → Search/Filter → Product Detail → Wishlist/Save → Add to Cart → Checkout
  * Homepage → Login/Register (SSO options) → Profile Management → Order History
  * Homepage → Blog/Content → Product Promotion → Product Detail
  * [Vercel Next.js eCommerce Example](https://github.com/vercel/commerce)
  * [Medusa Next.js Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa)

**5.2. Wireframes & Templates (Link to Design Files):**  
Link to example design artifacts.
  * [Tailwind Plus example UI block code](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks)
  * [Flowbite UI blocks code](https://flowbite.com/blocks/)

**5.3. Accessibility & Usability Considerations:**  
  1. All color contrasts for text and interactive elements must meet [WCAG 2.1 AA standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/).  
  2. Ensure robust mobile responsiveness across all screen sizes and orientations.  
  3. Interactive elements (buttons, links, sliders) must have adequate touch target sizes and clear visual feedback.  
  4. Navigation should be intuitive and consistent across the site.  
  5. **Dynamic Light/Dark Mode:** The light mode and dark mode will be controlled by a slider, dynamically changing across multiple color gradients for background and font colors. These gradients will visually represent the progression from sunrise to sunset, and moonrise to moonset, aligning with the "LunaSolscape" brand aesthetic. Color transitions will be smooth and meet accessibility contrast standards at all stages.

## **6\. Technical & System Requirements (The "How" \- Engineering)**

* **6.1. High-Level Architecture / Technical Approach (Link to Docs):**  
  * **Modular Architecture:** The website will be built with a modular architecture to ensure ease of maintenance, scalability, and future extensibility. This involves clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and data layers.  
  * **Frontend:** Built with 
  1. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) (latest version preferred for developer community support) utilizing React for UI components. UI blocks and components will leverage [TailwindCSS v4.1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/), and Tailwind Plus for rapid and consistent development using free and open-source templates from established players like [Vercel's Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) or Payload CMS templates.  
  * **Backend & Admin:** A robust backend will be developed, potentially utilizing an open-source headless CMS like [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/docs) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload)) for efficient content and product catalog management (features 4.3.4, 4.3.6, 4.3.7). This will provide a flexible API layer and an intuitive admin dashboard for sales and branding managers.  
  * **Database:** SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for core e-commerce data.  
  * **Dynamic Theme Implementation:** Frontend will implement logic for the light/dark mode slider, dynamically applying CSS gradients based on user selection, reflecting sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset color palettes. Search for examples online.
* **6.2. Key Integrations & APIs:**  
  * **Payment Gateways:** [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs), [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/), and other globally supported providers.  
  * **Shipping APIs:** Major carriers like [FedEx Developer Resources](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-us/home.html), DHL Express API, [USPS Web Tools](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/welcome.htm) for automated tracking.  
  * **SSO Providers:** Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook. Refer to official developer docs.
  * **Marketplace APIs/SDKs:** Alibaba, TikTok Shop, Instagram Shop, Facebook Marketplace, AliExpress, Taobao (API/SDK availability and documentation for business accounts to be thoroughly researched).
  * **Content Management (Blog):** Markdown parser integration.
* **6.3. Non-Functional Requirements:**  
  * *Performance:* Page load times under 2 seconds for critical paths (homepage, product pages) on mobile and desktop. Maximize [HTML5 capabilities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) and client-side caching (e.g., Service Workers, localStorage for non-sensitive data) where cybersecurity is not an issue, to enhance speed and offline capabilities.  
  * *Scalability:* Architecture must support rapid user and product catalog growth, accommodating seasonal traffic spikes.  
  * *Security:* Implement industry-standard security practices for data encryption (at rest and in transit), authentication, authorization, and payment processing. Regular security audits. Adhere to all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)).  
  * *Reliability:* 99.9% uptime target for the e-commerce platform.  
  * *Maintainability:* Clean, modular code with comprehensive documentation and automated testing.  
* **6.4. Data Model & Storage Considerations:**  
  * A relational schema will be designed to store customer profiles, order history, product details (including SKU, variants, colors, warranties), inventory, and blog content. Data will be normalized to ensure integrity and efficient querying.
